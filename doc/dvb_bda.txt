    Merge branch 'windvb' into staging

    Add experimental DVB support to Windows builds. For the most part, this
    should be compatible with the dvb_input module on Linux; see known issue
    list.

    BDA drivers must be installed in order for the module to work; legacy WDM
    drivers are not supported. Refer to src/hwdev/bda/module.c for a complete
    listing of available options, their values and methods.

    Example configuration #1:

        my_dvb = dvb_tune({
            name = "DVB-T Card",

            adapter = 0,
            -- OR: --
            devpath = "see output from astra.exe --devices",

            type = "T",
            frequency = "674",
            bandwidth = "8MHz",
        })

        make_channel({
            name = "Test Channel",
            input = { "dvb://my_dvb#pnr=1" },
            output = { "udp://239.10.10.10" },
        })

    Example configuration #2:

        my_dvb = dvb_tune({
            name = "DVB-S Card",
            adapter = 0,

            type = "S2",
            tp = "11045:H:44922",
            lnb = "9750:10600:11700",
            fec = "5/6",

            budget = true, -- no PID filter
        })

        make_channel({
            name = "Whole Transponder",
            input = { "dvb://my_dvb" },
            output = { "file://./11045.ts" },
        })

    Command line examples:

        List installed DVB adapters:
        > astra.exe --devices dvb_input

        Get signal lock and run built-in TS analyzer:
        > astra.exe --analyze "dvb://#adapter=0&type=s&tp=11045:h:44922"
        'budget' option is added automatically for --analyze on dvb:// URLs.

        Monitor signal status (adapter can still be used by other software):
        > astra.exe --femon --debug "dvb://#adapter=0&type=s"

    Known issues:
    - Transport Information Filter (TIF) leaks memory every time the graph
      is set up and torn down. Fixing this is impossible without writing a
      replacement TIF from scratch.
    - No support for CI CAM slots and DiSEqC (backend code for these features
      has to be written specifically for each card vendor).
    - Same goes for error correction statistics (BER/UNC) because BDA doesn't
      support it without vendor extensions.
    - PLP/ISI setting (stream_id) is only implemented for TBS and Omicom cards.
    - ATSC, CQAM and ISDB-T/S are completely untested.

    Minor issues:
    - Lua callback field names are different from the Linux version.
    - 'raw_signal' option is not implemented; signal quality and strength
      are always reported as percentages.
    - USB hotplug doesn't work with no_dvr (--femon) option.
    - femon app can only monitor signal status, no tuning.
      Use --analyze and 'log_signal' option instead if you need to tune
      the device.

    Changes not directly related to BDA support:
    - hwdev/dvbapi: rename 'device' option to 'frontend' [37562601]
    - replace --dvbls option with --devices [bdd01512, 60fef582]
    - libastra: use Unicode APIs on Windows
      [ae913f52, f8860dd9, b7ced360, 0cdf0e01, 7a25bda9, 30bd660c]
    - core/compat: add COM convenience macros [1f649b61]
    - core/log: add locks, VA functions and win32 unicode support [d7399260]
    - mpegts/tscore: clean up namespace [b9e7d119]
