    Merge branch 'it95x_output' into staging

    Add support for modulators based on the ITE IT9500 series chips, such as
    the UT-100C transmitter dongle from HiDes. This feature only works on
    Windows at this time.

    List of tested hardware:
    - UT-100C
      TX-only model based on IT9507.

    - UT-100A
      Same as UT-100C with the addition of an IT9133-based receiver, which
      shows up as a DVB input in --devices listing and can be used as a normal
      DVB-T receiver.

    - UT-210
      DVB-T/ISDB-T transmitter based on the newer IT9517 chip. This one has
      some extra features, such as hardware PCR restamping and a proprietary
      RF encryption scheme. Reception of produced ISDB-T signal has not been
      tested.

    Modulator performance is greatly affected by the USB host controller.
    Dedicated, non-virtualized USB 3 ports are recommended for stable and
    jitter-free operation.

    See doc/examples/it95x.lua for configuration examples.
