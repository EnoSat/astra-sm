    Merge branch 'pipe_posix' into staging

    This is an implementation of the pipe:// protocol along with units and
    routines for manipulating child processes. Despite the branch name it
    should also work on Windows.

    Usage examples:

    Channel input:
        make_channel({
            name = "Pipe Channel",
            input = { "pipe://cat test.ts#sync" },
        })

    Shared channel input (e.g. MPTS):
        big_pipe = make_pipe({
            command = "cat test.ts",
            sync = true,
            sync_opts = "40",
        })
        make_channel({
            name = "Channel A",
            input = { "pipe://big_pipe#pnr=100" },
        })
        make_channel({
            name = "Channel B",
            input = { "pipe://big_pipe#pnr=200" },
        })
        make_channel({
            name = "Channel C",
            input = { "pipe://big_pipe#pnr=300" },
        })

    Channel output (sync not supported):
        make_channel({
            output = { "pipe://cat >/dev/null" },
        })

    Known issues:
    1. Pipe output is experimental, untested and highly inefficient.
    2. Using an external process as a filter is not implemented yet.
    3. Lua methods for interacting with the child are not implemented yet.

    Windows version can be compiled using MinGW-w64 and MSYS2 with
    either GCC or Clang.
